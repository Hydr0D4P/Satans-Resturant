          <h2>The Project</h2>

            <p>
              This website is a project and not a real resturant/cafe, its simply a mock up in order to practice using
              html, css, and the use of github. If you stumble opon this website, know it was made in september 2021.
              I thought it would be funny if there was a Cafe that just so happened to have satanic imagery. I am not
              Satanic, and just enjoyed the idea of the contrast between Satanism, and a cafe.

            <h2>Accessability</h2>
              <p>
                If you were to take a look at the HTML and CSS for this page, I've tried to make things as accessible as I can. There are definitely things that could be improved, but I've done what I could. I picked a background that has colours that contrast pretty well against white, and where I can, there is a transparent background around the text. There is also an outline class that is used where the background is either simply not enough or where a background could not be used. In an earlier iteration of this page, the navigation bar used to have 6 or 7 different pages to jump to. I found that to be incredibly confusing and it doesn't really help the page in any way. I wanted to have the navbar follow the scroll, and potentially even have drop-down menus, but I settled for something simpler to prevent things from breaking. Being colourblind myself, I often find myself really struggling to navigate websites with a lot of colours, so I’ve done my best to prevent that from happening to others.

                When dealing with mobile, it’s relatively simple to make the site work. The phone usually does all the magic for you. But when it comes to resolution, however, the page tends to break. An issue I had for a while was that the buttons you see on the Mainpage, and the Dishes page, would simply go everywhere at certain resolutions. I added some overflow and some padding to fix this issue, but the dropdown menu for the allergens on the dishes would add a scroll bar to the letterboxes. The fix to this was simply changing the button from a dropdown, to just displaying the allergens in the button itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                After checking the WCAG the site only came up with a single error which is that the Mainpage’s h1, doesn't have enough contrast between the background and the foreground. I simply added an outline to the text. 
              </p>

                Something that I always appreciate about certain websites is that you can navigate them without having to use the mouse. Quickly tabbing through a website is not only fast, but also smooth. The website is almost entirely able to be tabbed through, with the one exception being the Allergens buttons. They are definitely not impossible to read by only using your keyboard, but it might be hard to read them for people who struggle to use a mouse. Given more time and practice there most definitely is an elegant solution to this.

              <p>
                The website does look quite dated, mainly due to the colours used, as they come off as being incredibly 2002. Changing the background to a plain grey would make the website look substantially more modern, but I think it takes away a lot of character.
              </p>

                When building anything, adding options for accessibility doesn’t only benefit the disabled, but also adds to the site as a whole. I’ve tried to do this by simplifying and clarifying, and I will keep it in mind for future and larger projects, as it is a net positive thing to do.
